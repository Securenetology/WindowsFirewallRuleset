## About Windows Firewall Ruleset

- Windows firewall rules sorted into individual PowerShell scripts according to:

1. Rule group
2. Traffic direction
3. IP version (IPv4 / IPv6)
4. Further sorted according to programs and services

- Such as for example:

1. ICMP traffic
2. Browser rules
3. Rules for Windows system
4. Store apps
5. Windows services
6. Multiplayer Games
7. Microsoft programs
8. 3rd party programs
9. broadcast traffic
10. multicast traffic
11. and the list goes on...

- In addition to firewall rules you will find a number of PowerShell modules,
scripts and functions used to gather environment info relevant to build specialized firewall such as:

1. Computers on network
2. Installed programs
3. Users on system or network
4. Network configuration
5. Managing firewall etc.

- Meaning this project is a good base to easily extend your firewall and include more rules and
functionalities.
- Currently there are some 800+ firewall rules, 10+ modules with 100+ functions, several scripts
and a bunch of useful documentation.
- You can choose which rules you want, and apply only those or apply them all with
master script to your firewall.
- All of the rules are loaded into Local Group Policy (GPO),
giving you full power over the default Windows firewall.

## Core benefits of this firewall project

1. System administrators would usually just avoid boggling too much with firewall because detailed
firewall configuration is very time consuming process, takes a lot of troubleshooting, changes require
testing and security auditing and it only gets worse if you want to deploy firewall to hundreds or
thousands of remote computers, for example not all computers might have same software environment.

2. Unlike firewall rules in control panel, these rules are loaded into GPO firewall
(Local group policy), meaning system settings changes or random programs which install rules as
part of their installation process will have no effect on firewall unless you
explicitly make an exception.

3. Unlike default (predefined) Windows firewall rules, these rules are more restrictive such as,
tied to explicit user accounts, rules apply to specific ports,
network interfaces, specific programs, services etc.

4. Unlike in usual scenario, you will know which rules have no effect or are redundant
due to ex. uninstalled program, a missing Windows service which no longer exists, renamed
executable after Windows upgrade or are redundant/invalid for what ever other reason.

5. Updating rule attributes such as ports, addresses and similar is much easier since these rules
are in scripts, you can use editor tools such as CTRL + F, regex or multicursor to perform bulk
operations on your rules, doing this in Windows firewall GUI is beyond all pain.

6. Default outbound is "block" unless there is a rule to explicitly allow network traffic,
in default Windows firewall this is not possible unless you have rules for every possible
program/service, thanks to this collection of rules, setting default outbound to block
requires very little additional work.

7. A good portion of code is dedicated to provide unified and automated solution to build and define
firewall specialized for target system, minimizing the need to do something manually and saving you
valuable administration time.

License files and and Copyright notices are maintained **"per file"**.

3rd party and sublicensed code is located either inside their own folders (with individual license file)
or inside folders called `External` for organizational purposes.

## Requirements

1. Following x64 operating systems are currently tested:
   - Windows 10 Professional
   - Windows 10 Enterprise
   - Windows 10 Education
   - Windows Server 2019 Standard
   - Windows Server 2019 Datacenter
2. Windows PowerShell 5.1 or PowerShell Core 7.1 [Download PowerShell Core][download core]
3. .NET Framework 4.5 (Windows PowerShell only) [Download Net Framework][download .net]
4. Git (Optional) [Download Git][download git]
5. Visual Studio Code (Recommended) [Download VSCode][vscode]
6. PowerShell Support for VSCode (Recommended) [Download extension][download powershell extension]
7. PSScriptAnalyzer (Recommended) [Download PSScriptAnalyzer][module psscriptanalyzer]

Requirements details:

- All operating systems 10.0 (Major 10, Minor 0) build 1809 and up are supported,
but only those editions listed in point 1 are actively tested.\
The list of other untested but supported systems and features is in [The future](#the-future)
- PowerShell "Core" is not built into Windows, you will need to install it separately\
or use [Windows PowerShell](Readme/WindowsPowerShell.md) which is already installed.
- .NET Framework version 4.5 is required if using Windows PowerShell (Desktop edition)
instead of PowerShell Core.\
Windows 10 v1903 and up already includes .NET 4.8
- You might want to have git to check out for updates,
to easily switch between branches or to contribute code.
- VS Code is preferred and recommended editor to navigate project and edit scripts for your
needs or contribution.
- If you get VSCode, you'll also need PowerShell extension for code navigation and
PowerShell specific features.
- To navigate and edit code with VSCode, `PSScriptAnalyzer` is recommended otherwise editing
experience may behave really odd due to other project settings.
- Hardware requirements are min. 8GB of memory and SSD drive to work on project, otherwise to just
apply rules to your personal firewall less than that should work just fine!

## I don't meet the requirements

At the moment this project is tested and designed for most recent Windows Desktop/Servers and that
is known to work, making use of it on older systems requires additional work.

Testing is done on 64 bit Windows, a small fraction of rules won't work for 32 bit system and
need adjustment, full functionality for 32 bit system is work in progress.\
For now you can load rules on 32 bit system just fine with the exception of few rules probably not
relevant at all for your configuration.

[Legacy Support](Readme/LegacySupport.md) describes how to make use of this project on older
Windows systems such as Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008

## First time user

Following are short warnings and notices first time user should be aware of

### Warning

- You might loose internet connectivity for some of your programs or in rare cases even lose internet
connectivity completely, if that happens, you can either temporarily allow outbound network traffic
or run `Scripts\ResetFirewall.ps1` script, to reset GPO firewall to system defaults and remove all rules.
- Inside `Readme` folder there is a `ResetFirewall.md`, a guide on how to do it manually, by hand,
if for some reason you're unable to run the script, or the script doesn't solve your problems.
- Also note that your current/existing rules will not be deleted unless you have rules in GPO whose
group name interfere with group names from this ruleset, however
**this does not apply to** `Scripts\ResetFirewall.ps1` which will clear GPO rules completely
and leave only those in control panel.
- If you want to be 100% sure please export your current GPO rules first, to do so either run
`Scripts\ExportFirewall.ps1` which may take some time or do it manually.\
For manual export see [Manage GPO Firewall](Readme/ManageGPOFirewall.md)
- You will be asked which rules to load, to minimize internet connectivity trouble you should
apply at least all generic networking and OS related rules such as CoreNetworking, ICMP,
WindowsSystem, WindowsServices, Multicast etc; and all rules for which you have programs installed
on system, also do not ignore IPv6, Windows does need IPv6!
It should be easy to delete what you don't need in GPO, rather than later dig trough code to see
what you might have missed.
- Default configuration will set global firewall behavior which is not configurable in GPO GUI,
such as `stateful ftp` and `pptp` or global `IPSec` settings, if you need specific setup please visit
`Scripts\SetupProfile.ps1` and take a look at `Set-NetFirewallSetting`.\
Note that `Scripts\SetupProfile.ps1` is automatically called by `Scripts\SetupFirewall.ps1` script
- Some scripts require network adapter to be connected to network, for example to determine
IPv4 broadcast address. (Otherwise errors may be generated without completing the task)

### Note

- If you would like to customize how scripts run, such as force loading rules and various
defaults then visit `Config\ProjectSettings.ps1` and there you'll find global variables
which are used for this.
- Loading rules into an empty GPO should be very fast, however loading into GPO which already
contains rules will be significantly slower (depends on number of existing rules)
- All errors and warnings will be saved to `Logs` directory, you can review these logs later if you
want to fix some problem, most warnings can be safely ignored but errors should be resolved.
- Any rule that results in "access denied" while loading should be reloaded by executing specific
script again, see [FAQ.md](Readme/FAQ.md)
for information on why this may happen.
- If the project was manually downloaded, transferred from another computer or media then you should\
unblock all files in project first to avoid YES/NO spam questions for every executing script,
by running `Scripts\UnblockProject.ps1` script.\
Master script `Scripts\SetupFirewall.ps1` does this in case if you forget, but initial YES/NO spam questions
will still be visible in that case.
- If you download project to location that is under "Ransomware protection" (in Windows Defender),
make sure to whitelist either `pwsh.exe` or `powershell.exe` otherwise unblocking project files may fail.
PowerShell must be restarted for "Controlled folder access" changes to take effect.
- It's important to understand these rules are designed to be used as "Standard" user, not as
Administrative user, if you're Administrator on your computer you'll have to either create standard
user account and use that for your everyday life or modify rules to allow Administrator online access.
See [FAQ entry](Readme/FAQ.md#does-this-firewall-project-give-me-the-right-protection) for more
information why using Administrative account is dangerous security wise.
- Windows or software updates may rename executables or their locations, also user accounts may be
renamed by Administrator, therefore it's important to reload specific rules from time to time as
needed to update firewall for system changes that may happen at any time.

## Quick start

1. If you don't have ssh keys and other setup required to clone via SSH then either clone with HTTPS
or just download released zip file by clicking on "Releases" here on this site, and then for latest
release under "assets" download zip file.\
These steps here assume you have downloaded a zip file from "assets" section under "Releases".
2. Extract the archive somewhere, these steps assume you've extracted the zip (project root directory)
into `C:\` root drive directly.
3. If you would like to use Windows PowerShell 5.1 instead of PowerShell Core see:\
[How to open Windows PowerShell](Readme/WindowsPowerShell.md)
4. Otherwise procedure for both PowerShell Core and desktop is the same:\
Open up extracted folder, right click into an empty space and there is an option to run
PowerShell Core as Administrator (Assumes you enabled context menu during installment of PowerShell
Core) if not open it manually.
5. Now if you don't have PowerShell context menu then move to C root drive by executing following 2
lines, this is where you extracted your downloaded zip file:

    ```powershell
    c:
    cd \
    ```

6. cd into downloaded folder, of course rename the command if your extracted folder is called
something else:

    ```powershell
    cd WindowsFirewallRuleset-master
    ```

7. Type or copy/paste following commands and hit enter for each

    ```powershell
    Get-ExecutionPolicy
    ```

    Remember what the output of the above command is, note that PowerShell Core defaults to `RemoteSigned`
    while Windows PowerShell defaults to `Restricted` on non server editions.

8. Set execution policy to unrestricted to be able to unblock project files,
(Note that `RemoteSigned` will work only once scripts are unblocked)

    ```powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
    ```

    You will be prompted to accept execution policy change, type `Y` and press enter to accept.\
    For more information see [About Execution Policies][about execution policies]

9. At this point you should "unblock" all project files first by executing the script called `Scripts\UnblockProject.ps1`,
btw. project files were blocked by Windows to prevent users from running untrusted script code
downloaded from internet:

    ```powershell
    .\Scripts\UnblockProject.ps1
    ```

    Make sure your answer is `R` that is `[R] Run once` as many times as needed to unblock project.

10. Once project files are unblocked set execution policy to `RemoteSigned`:

    ```powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
    ```

    You will be again prompted to accept execution policy change, type `Y` and press enter to accept.

11. Rules for programs such as internet browser, Visual Studio etc. depend on installation variables.\
Most paths are auto-searched and variables are updated, otherwise you get warning and description
on how to fix the problem.\
If needed, you can find these installation variables in individual scripts inside `Rules` folder.\
It is recommended to close down all other programs before running master script in the next step

12. Back to PowerShell console and type into console:

    ```powershell
    .\Scripts\SetupFirewall.ps1
    ```

    Hit enter and you will be asked questions such as what kind of rulesets you want.\
    If you need help to decide whether to run some rules or not, type `?` and press enter.

13. Follow prompt output, (ex. hit enter to accept default action),
it will take at least 10 minutes of your attention.

14. If you encounter errors or warnings, you have options such as, ignore the errors/warnings
or update script that produced the error and re-run that script once again later.

15. Now that rules are applied you might need to adjust some of them in Local Group Policy,
not all the rules are enabled by default and you might want to toggle default Allow/Block behavior for
some rules, rules for programs which don't exist need to be made additionally.

16. Now go ahead and test your internet connection (ex. with browser or some other program),
If you're unable to connect to internet after applying these rules you have several options:

    - Temporarily open outbound firewall in GPO or [Disable Firewall](Readme/DisableFirewall.md)
    - Troubleshoot problems: [Network troubleshooting detailed guide](Readme/NetworkTroubleshooting.md)
    - You can [Reset Firewall to previous state](Readme/ResetFirewall.md)
    - Take a look into `Readme` folder for more troubleshooting options and documentation

17. If you don't plan to remotely manage target machine make sure to undo changes done to
`WinRM` service (Windows Remote Management), the service might have been set to automatic and
started as a prerequisite to setup firewall. (The default is "Manual" startup)

## Manage loaded rules

There are 2 mothods to manage your rules:

1. Using Local Group Policy, this method gives you limited freedom on what you can do with project
rules, such as disabling them, changing some attributes or adding new rules. For more information see:
[Manage GPO Firewall](Readme/ManageGPOFirewall.md)

2. Editing PowerShell scripts, this method gives you full control, you can change or remove existing
with no restriction or add new ones.

What ever your plan or setup is, you will surely need to perform additional work such as adding more
rules in GPO to allow programs for which rules don't exist, or to reconfigure existing rules.

Rules are loaded into local group policy, follow steps below to open local group policy.

1. Press Windows key and type: `secpol.msc`
2. Right click on `secpol.msc` and click `Run as administrator`
3. If prompted for password, enter administrator password and click "Yes" to continue
4. Expand node: `Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security`
5. Expand node: `Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security - Local Group Policy Object`
6. Click on either `Inbound`, `Outbound` or `Windows Defender Firewall...` node to view and manage
rules and settings applied with PowerShell.

For more information about GPO see: [Configure security policy settings][configure security policy settings]

## Applying individual rulesets

If you want to apply only specific rules there are 2 ways to do this:

1. Execute `Scripts\SetupFirewall.ps1` and chose `Yes` only for rulesets you want, otherwise chose `No`
and hit enter to skip current ruleset.

2. With PowerShell navigate to folder containing the ruleset script you want,
and execute individual PowerShell script.

3. You might want to run `Scripts\SetupProfile.ps1` afterwards to apply default firewall behavior if
it's not set already, or you can do it manually in GPO but with limited power.
"limited power" means `Scripts\SetupProfile.ps1` configures some firewall parameters which can't be
adjusted in firewall GUI.

In all 3 cases the script will delete all of the existing rules that match rule group (if any),
and load rules from script into Local Group Policy.

## Deleting rules

At the moment there are 3 options to delete firewall rules:

1. The easiest way is to select all the rules you want to delete in Local Group Policy,
right click and delete.

2. To delete rules according to file there is a function for this purpose, located in:\
`Modules\Ruleset.Firewall\Public\Remove-FirewallRules.ps1`\
however you're advised to perform some tests before using it due to it's
experimental state.

3. To revert to your old firewall state (the one in control panel), you will need to delete all off
the rules from GPO, and set all properties to `"Not configured"` after right click on node:\
`Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security - Local Group Policy Object`

    Deleting all rules or revetting to previous state can also be done with
    `Scripts\ResetFirewall.ps1` script.

    Note that you will also need to re-import your exported GPO rules if you had them.

## Export\Import rules

If you want to export rules from GPO there are 2 methods available:

1. Export in local group policy by clicking on `Export Policy...` menu, after right click on node:\
`Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security - Local Group Policy Object`

2. To export using PowerShell run `Scripts\ExportFirewall.ps1` which is much slower process but
unlike method from point 1 you can customize your export in almost any way you want.

If you want to import rules, importing by using GPO is same as for export, and to import with
PowerShell just run `Scripts\ImportFirewall.ps1` which will pick up your previous export file.

To customize your export\import please take a look into `Modules\Ruleset.Firewall\Public`,
which is where you'll find description on how to use export\import module functions.

**NOTE:** Method 2 is experimental, very slow and not 100% reliable, you're advised to verify results.

## Checking for updates

This repository consists of 2 branches, `master` and `develop`, develop (possibly unstable) branch is
the most recent one and is the one where all commits (updates) directly go so it's work in progress,
unlike master branch which is updated from develop branch once in a while and
not before all scripts are fully tested, meaning master brach is stable.

So if you're fine to experiment with development version switch to "develop" branch and try
it out, otherwise if development version produces errors for you switch back to "master".

There are two methods to be up to date with firewall:

1. First method requires you to download scripts, first use the "branch" button here on this site to
switch to either master or develop branch, next use "Code" button and either clone or
download zip.

2. Second method is good if you want to do it with PowerShell console without visiting this site,
you will need [git][download git], [github account][github join], a [fork][github fork] of this
repository in your github account and [SSH key][github ssh] to check for new updates on daily,
weekly or what ever other basis you want, follow steps below to check for updates once you installed
git and cloned your own fork:

- Right click on Start button in Windows
- Click `Windows PowerShell` to open PowerShell
- First navigate to folder where your instance of WindowsFirewallRuleset instance is, for example:
- Type: `dir` to list directories, ```cd SomeDirectoryName``` to move to some directory or
```cd ..``` to go one directory back
- Type: (or copy paste command(s) and hit enter) ```cd WindowsFirewallRuleset```
to move into WindowsFirewallRuleset folder

Following command (SSH) is typed only once for initial setup:

```git remote add upstream git@github.com:metablaster/WindowsFirewallRuleset.git```

Otherwise if you cloned your fork via HTTPS and want HTTPS (no SSH), then:

```git remote add upstream https://github.com/metablaster/WindowsFirewallRuleset.git```

- Following 2 sets of commands are typed each time,
to tell git you want updates from master (stable) branch:
- Type: ```git checkout master```
- Type: ```git fetch upstream```
- Type: ```git merge upstream/master```

- Following commands are to tell git you want updates from develop (possibly unstable) branch
- Type: ```git checkout develop```
- Type: ```git fetch upstream```
- Type: ```git merge upstream/develop```

Of course you can switch from one branch to another with git in PowerShell as many times as you
want and all files will be auto updated without the need to re-download or re-setup anything.

Keep in mind that you need to save and upload your modifications to your fork,
for more info on how to use git see [git documentation][git docs]

That's it, your scripts are now up to date, execute them as you desire (or follow steps from
"Quick start" section) to apply changes to your firewall.

## Contributing or suggestions

Below are general notes for requesting to add your rules or ideas about project.\
If you would like to contribute by writing code you should read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
instead.

Feel free to suggest or contribute new rules, or improvements for existing rules or scripts.\
Just make sure you follow below notices:

1. Provide some documentation or reference (preferably official) for your rules so that it can be
easy to verify these rules don't contain mistakes, ex. for ICMP rules you would provide a link
to [IANA][iana] with relevant reference document.

2. To suggest new rules or various rule and code improvements, please open new issue here on github
and provide details preferably with documentation.

3. To contribute rules, it is also important that each rule contains good description of it's
purpose, when the user clicks on rule in firewall GUI he/she wants to see what this rule is about
and easily conclude whether to enable/disable rule or allow/block network traffic.

4. It is also important that the rule is very specific and not generic, that means specifying protocol,
IP addresses, ports, system user, interface type and other relevant information.\
For example just saying: allow TCP outbound port 2891 for my new game without telling where, why
or which user account to allow, or no explanation what this is supposed to allow or block is not acceptable.

## Customization

If you would like to customize project code or add more firewall rules to suit your private or corporate
interests then first step is to set up development environment and learn about project best practices
all of which is explained in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)

Depending on your situation and target platform you might also want to read [Legacy Support](Readme/LegacySupport.md)

These 2 documents are bare minimum to get you started customizing this repository, the rest can be
found in `Readme` folder and by doing your own research.

## More information and help

Inside [Readme](Readme) folder you will find useful information not only about this project but also
general information on how to troubleshoot firewall and network problems, or gather other relevant information.

It might answer some of your questions, for example [Monitoring Firewall](Readme/MonitoringFirewall.md)
explains how to monitor firewall in real time.

## The future

Following features are desired and might be available at some point in the future:

1. Remote firewall administration

   - Applying firewall configuration to remote computers on domain or home networks

2. Comprehensive firewall rulesets for Windows Server editions

3. On demand or scheduled registry scan to validate integrity of active firewall filtering policy

   - Any firewall rule in the registry that is not part of this repository is reported for review
   - Because, malware, hackers and even trusted software might attempt to bypass firewall at any time

4. Full functionality for the following editions of Windows 10.0
   - Windows 10 Pro for Workstations
   - Windows 10 Pro Education
   - Windows 10 IoT Core Blast
   - Windows 10 IoT Enterprise
   - Windows 10 S
   - Windows Server 2019 Essentials
