# Scripts\Security directory

This subdirectory contains scripts used to manage Windows security.

These scripts are unrelated to firewall, they are here for you if you wish to go beyond `Windows
Firewall Ruleset` and adjust target system for maximum security possible with PowerShell.

In particular these scripts are used to manage the following:

- Microsoft Defender Antivirus
- Digital signature verification across system and virus total scan of entire system
- Windows privacy options
