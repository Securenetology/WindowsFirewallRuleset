.SYNOPSIS
Outbound firewall rules for IPv4 multicast

.DESCRIPTION
Outbound firewall rules for IPv4 multicast address Space

.PARAMETER Force
If specified, no prompt to run script is shown.

.PARAMETER Trusted
If specified, rules will be loaded for executables with missing or invalid digital signature.
By default an error is generated and rule isn't loaded.

.EXAMPLE
PS> .\Multicast.ps1

.INPUTS
None. You cannot pipe objects to Multicast.ps1

.OUTPUTS
None. Multicast.ps1 does not generate any output

.NOTES
NOTE: Boot time multicast dropped due to WFP Operation (Windows Filtering Platform), the transition from
boot-time to persistent filters could be several seconds, or even longer on a slow machine.

The assignment is made, for a domain with a 16-bit Autonomous System Number (ASN),
by mapping a domain's autonomous system number, expressed in octets as X.Y, into the middle two
octets of the GLOP Block, yielding an assignment of 233.X.Y.0/24.
The mapping and assignment is defined in [RFC3180].
Domains with a 32-bit ASN MAY apply for space in AD-HOC Block III,
or consider using IPv6 multicast addresses." |

	-Description "[RFC3138] delegated to the RIRs the assignment of the GLOP sub-block mapped by
the private Autonomous System (AS) space (64512-65534) and the IANA reserved ASN 65535.
This space was known as Extended GLOP (EGLOP).
RFC 3138 should not have asked the RIRs to develop policies for the EGLOP space because [RFC2860]
reserves that to the IETF.
It is important to make this space available for use by network operators,
and it is therefore appropriate to obsolete RFC 3138 and classify this address range as available
for AD-HOC assignment." |

multicast addresses.
By delegating multicast addresses at the same time as unicast prefixes, network operators will
be able to identify their multicast addresses without needing to run an inter-domain
allocation protocol." |
