.SYNOPSIS
Outbound firewall rules for store apps

.DESCRIPTION
Outbound rules for store apps

.EXAMPLE
PS> .\StoreApps.ps1

.INPUTS
None. You cannot pipe objects to StoreApps.ps1

.OUTPUTS
None. StoreApps.ps1 does not generate any output

.NOTES
TODO: exclude store apps rules for servers, store app folders seem to exist but empty.
TODO: currently making rules for each user separately, is it possible to make rules for all users?

NOTE: Following "rules" apply for store apps for blocking/allowing users
1. -Owner - Only one explicit user account can be specified (not group, not capability etc...)
2. -LocalUser - Anything can be specified
3. Either -Owner or -LocalUser can be specified, not both which would make the rule not working and useless
4. If the LocalUser is specified and rule is blocking, then another allow rule (with? or without owner) may take precedence over blocking rule
5. If the owner is specified, the rule is well formed and normal "rules" apply as with all other rules
6. Conclusion is, the -LocalUser parameter can be specified instead of -Owner only to allow traffic that was not already
   blocked by rules with owner parameter specified
7. All of this applies only to "Any" and "*" packages, for specific package only -Owner must be
   specified and -LocalUser is not valid for specific packages

TODO: Prompt or refuse running this script on server platforms (platforms with no apps)
TODO: Rule display names don't have all consistent casing (ex. microsoft vs Microsoft)

HACK: in Firewall GUI the rule may state wrong user in "Application packages" window,
but the SID is the same for all users anyway, so OK,
also it doesn't matter because in the GUI, SID radio button is checked, not the package name.

TODO: rules for *some* apps which have not been updated by user will not work,
example solitaire app; need to either update them or detect this case.

NOTE: updating apps will not work unless also "Extension users" are updated in
WindowsServices.ps1, meaning re-run the script.

TODO: We can learn app display name from manifest
TODO: OfficeHub app contains sub app "LocalBridge" which is blocked

NOTE: If OneNote app fails to install, start "Print Spooler" service and try again
