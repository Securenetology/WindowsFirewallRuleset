Privacy refers to the control that you have over your personal information and how that information
is used.\
Personal information is any information that can be used to determine your identity such as email,
credit card or bank details, home address, birthdate, geographical location etc.\
Personal information may also refer to hardware ID's, IP address, browsing habits etc. which if
gained access to may uniquely identify you or your system.

Security, on the other hand, refers to how your personal information is protected.\
Security generally refers to the prevention of unauthorized access of data,
often involving protection against hackers or cyber criminals.

In regard to `Windows Firewall Ruleset`, an example of privacy issue would be a firewall rule or
portion of source code which leaks yours or someones else's personal information.\

attacker compromise yours or someones else's system.\
Security issue may also refer to system misconfiguration or loss of data.\
