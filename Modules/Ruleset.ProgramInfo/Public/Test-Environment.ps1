.SYNOPSIS
Test if a path is valid with additional checks

.DESCRIPTION
Similar to Test-Path but expands environment variables and performs additional checks if desired:
1. check if input path is compatible for firewall rules.
2. check if the path leads to user profile
Both of which can be limited to either container or leaf path type.

.PARAMETER Path
Path to folder, Allows null or empty since input may come from other commandlets which
can return empty or null

.PARAMETER PathType
A type of path to test, can be one of the following:
1. Leaf -The path is file or registry entry
2. Container - the path is container such as folder or registry key
3. Any - Either Leaf or Container

.PARAMETER Firewall
Ensures the path is valid for firewall rule

.PARAMETER UserProfile
Checks if the path leads to user profile

.EXAMPLE
PS> Test-Environment "%Windir%"

True, The path is valid, and it exists

.EXAMPLE
PS> Test-Environment "'%Windir%\System32'"

False, Invalid path syntax

.EXAMPLE
PS> Test-Environment "%HOME%\AppData\Local\MicrosoftEdge" -Firewall -UserProfile

False, the path leads to userprofile but will not work for firewall rule

.EXAMPLE
PS> Test-Environment "%SystemDrive%\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\MicrosoftEdge" -Firewall -UserProfile

True, the path leads to userprofile and is good for firewall rule, and it exists

.EXAMPLE
Test-Environment "%LOCALAPPDATA%\MicrosoftEdge" -UserProfile

True, the path lead to user profile, and it exists

.INPUTS
None. You cannot pipe objects to Test-Environment

.OUTPUTS
[bool] true if path exists, false otherwise

.NOTES
TODO: This should proably be part of utility module,
it's here since only this module uses this function.
This function should be used only to verify paths for external usage, not for commandles which
don't expand system environment variables.
