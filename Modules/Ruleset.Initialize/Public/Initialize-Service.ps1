using namespace System.Management.Automation.Host

<#
.SYNOPSIS
Configure and start specified system services

.DESCRIPTION
Test if required system services are started, if not all services on which target service depends
are started before starting requested service and setting it to automatic startup.
Some services are essential for correct firewall and network functioning,
without essential services project code may result in errors hard to debug

.PARAMETER Services
An array of services to start

.EXAMPLE
PS> Initialize-Service @("lmhosts", "LanmanWorkstation", "LanmanServer")
$true if all input services are started successfully $false otherwise

.EXAMPLE
PS> Initialize-Service "WinRM"
$true if WinRM service was started $false otherwise

.INPUTS
[string[]] One or more service short names to check

.OUTPUTS
[bool]

.NOTES
This function main purpose is automated development environment setup to be able to perform quick
setup on multiple computers and virtual operating systems, in cases such as frequent system restores
for the purpose of testing project code for many environment scenarios that end users may have.
It should be used in conjunction with the rest of a module "Ruleset.Initialize"
TODO: Optionally set services to automatic startup, most of services are needed only to run code.
