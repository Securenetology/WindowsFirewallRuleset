.SYNOPSIS
Get broadcast addresses on the local machine

.DESCRIPTION
Return broadcast addresses, for each configured adapter.
This includes both physical and virtual adapters.
Returned broadcast addresses are only for IPv4

.PARAMETER IncludeAll
Include all possible adapter types present on target computer

.PARAMETER ExcludeHardware
Exclude hardware/physical network adapters

.PARAMETER IncludeVirtual
Whether to include virtual adapters

.PARAMETER IncludeHidden
Whether to include hidden adapters

.PARAMETER IncludeDisconnected
Whether to include disconnected

.EXAMPLE
PS> Get-Broadcast -IncludeAll

.EXAMPLE
PS> Get-Broadcast -IncludeAll -ExcludeHardware

.INPUTS
None. You cannot pipe objects to Get-Broadcast

.OUTPUTS
[ipaddress] Broadcast addresses

.NOTES
TODO: Some parameters most likely make no sense, otherwise we should return custom object,
separating addresses per adapter
