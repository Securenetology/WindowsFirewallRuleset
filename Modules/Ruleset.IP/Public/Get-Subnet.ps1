.SYNOPSIS
Get a list of subnets of a given size within a defined supernet.

.DESCRIPTION
Generates a list of subnets for a given network range using either
the address class or a user-specified value.

.PARAMETER IPAddress
Any address in the super-net range. Either a literal IP address,
a network range expressed as CIDR notation, or an IP address and subnet mask in a string.

.PARAMETER SubnetMask
The subnet mask of the network to split. Mandatory if the subnet mask is not included in the IPAddress parameter.

.PARAMETER NewSubnetMask
Split the existing network described by the IPAddress and subnet mask using this mask.

.EXAMPLE
PS> Get-Subnet 10.0.0.0 255.255.255.0 -NewSubnetMask 255.255.255.192

Four /26 networks are returned.

.EXAMPLE
PS> Get-Subnet 0/22 -NewSubnetMask 24

64 /24 networks are returned.

.INPUTS
None. You cannot pipe objects to Get-Subnet

.OUTPUTS
"Ruleset.IP.Subnet" [PSCustomObject]

.NOTES
Change log:
	07/03/2016 - Chris Dent - Cleaned up code, added tests.
	12/12/2015 - Chris Dent - Redesigned.
	13/10/2011 - Chris Dent - Created.

Modifications by metablaster year 2019, 2020:
- Include licenses and move comment based help outside of functions
- For code to be consistent with project code formatting and symbol casing.
- Removed unnecessary position arguments, added default argument values explicitly.
