.SYNOPSIS
Get a list of IP addresses within the specified network.

.DESCRIPTION
Get-NetworkRange finds the network and broadcast address as decimal values
then starts a counter between the two, returning IPAddress for each.

.PARAMETER IPAddress
Either a literal IP address, a network range expressed as CIDR notation,
or an IP address and subnet mask in a string.

.PARAMETER SubnetMask
A subnet mask as an IP address.

.PARAMETER IncludeNetworkAndBroadcast
Include the network and broadcast addresses when generating a network address range.

.PARAMETER Start
The start address of a range.

.PARAMETER End
The end address of a range.

.EXAMPLE
PS> Get-NetworkRange 192.168.0.0 255.255.255.0

Returns all IP addresses in the range 192.168.0.0/24.

.EXAMPLE
PS> Get-NetworkRange 10.0.8.0/22

Returns all IP addresses in the range 192.168.0.0 255.255.252.0.

.INPUTS
[string]

.OUTPUTS
[IPAddress]

.NOTES
Modifications by metablaster year 2019, 2020:
- Include licenses and move comment based help outside of functions
- For code to be consistent with project code formatting and symbol casing.
- Removed unnecessary position arguments, added default argument values explicitly.
