.SYNOPSIS
Tests an IP address to determine if it falls within IP address range

.DESCRIPTION
Test-SubnetMember attempts to determine whether or not an address or range falls within another range.
The network and broadcast address are calculated the converted to decimal then
compared to the decimal form of the submitted address.

.PARAMETER SubjectIPAddress
A representation of the subject, the network to be tested. Either a literal IP address,
a network range expressed as CIDR notation, or an IP address and subnet mask in a string.

.PARAMETER ObjectIPAddress
A representation of the object, the network to test against. Either a literal IP address,
a network range expressed as CIDR notation, or an IP address and subnet mask in a string.

.PARAMETER SubjectSubnetMask
A subnet mask as an IP address.

.PARAMETER ObjectSubnetMask
A subnet mask as an IP address.

.EXAMPLE
PS> Test-SubnetMember -SubjectIPAddress 10.0.0.0/24 -ObjectIPAddress 10.0.0.0/16

Returns true as the subject network can be contained within the object network.

.EXAMPLE
PS> Test-SubnetMember -SubjectIPAddress 192.168.0.0/16 -ObjectIPAddress 192.168.0.0/24

Returns false as the subject network is larger the object network.

.EXAMPLE
PS> Test-SubnetMember -SubjectIPAddress 10.2.3.4/32 -ObjectIPAddress 10.0.0.0/8

Returns true as the subject IP address is within the object network.

.EXAMPLE
PS> Test-SubnetMember -SubjectIPAddress 255.255.255.255 -ObjectIPAddress 0/0

Returns true as the subject IP address is the last in the object network range.

.INPUTS
None. You cannot pipe objects to Test-SubnetMember

.OUTPUTS
[bool]

.NOTES
Modifications by metablaster year 2019, 2020:

- Include licenses and move comment based help outside of functions
- For code to be consistent with project code formatting and symbol casing.
- Removed unnecessary position arguments, added default argument values explicitly.
