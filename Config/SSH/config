# Connection name as it will be displayed in Remote Explorer
Host VM-PRO

	# Specifies the real host name to log into.
	HostName VM-PRO

	# User name to which to log on on remote host
	User Admin

	# Specifies the port number to connect on the remote host.
	# The default is 22.
	Port 22

	# Specifies the protocol versions in order of preference.
	# The possible values are '1' and '2'.
	# protocol version 1 is NOT RECOMMENDED for security reasons.
	Protocol 2

	# Specifies which address family to use when connecting.
	# Valid arguments are: any, inet, inet6.
	AddressFamily any

	# Specifies the ciphers allowed for protocol version 2 in order of preference.
	# Multiple ciphers must be comma-separated.
	# Run: "ssh -Q cipher" to see available chipers
	Ciphers aes256-cbc,aes256-ctr

	# Specifies the host key signature algorithms that the server offers.
	# The list of available signature algorithms may be obtained using "ssh -Q key".
	# TODO: Not working
	# HostbasedAcceptedAlgorithms ecdsa-sha2-nistp256

	# Specifies the maximum amount of data that may be transmitted before the session key is renegotiated,
	# optionally followed by a maximum amount of time that may pass before the session key is renegotiated.
	# The first argument is specified in bytes and may have a suffix of 'K', 'M', or 'G' to indicate
	# Kilobytes, Megabytes, or Gigabytes, respectively.
	# The default is (default) between '1G' and '4G', depending on the cipher.
	# The optional second value is specified in seconds:
	# (none)  seconds
	# s | S   seconds
	# m | M   minutes
	# h | H   hours
	# d | D   days
	# w | W   weeks
	RekeyLimit default none

	# Specifies a file from which the user's identity key is read when using public key authentication.
	# This should be public key
	IdentityFile ~\\.ssh\\Remote-SSH.pub

	# Specifies whether to use password authentication.
	# The default is yes
	PasswordAuthentication yes

	# Specifies the number of password prompts before giving up.
	# The default is 3
	NumberOfPasswordPrompts 3

	# Specifies whether to try rhosts based authentication with public key authentication.
	HostbasedAuthentication no

	# the signature algorithms that will be used for hostbased authentication as a comma-separated list of patterns.
	# TODO: Reported as "Bad configuration option"
	# HostbasedAcceptedAlgorithms ecdsa-sha2-nistp256

	# This allows it to detect if a host key changed due to DNS spoofing and will add addresses of
	# destination hosts to ~/.ssh/known_hosts in the process, regardless of the setting of StrictHostKeyChecking
	# The default is no
	CheckHostIP no

	# ssh will never automatically add host keys to the ~/.ssh/known_hosts file, and refuses to
	# connect to hosts whose host key has changed.
	# This provides maximum protection against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks
	# "ask" means a new host keys will be added to the user known host files only after the user
	# has confirmed that is what they really want to do
	StrictHostKeyChecking ask

	# Specifies whether to use compression.
	# The default is no
	Compression no

	# Specifies the number of tries (one per second) to make before exiting.
	# The default is 1
	ConnectionAttempts 1

	# The timeout (in seconds) used when connecting to the SSH server, instead of using the default system TCP timeout.
	ConnectTimeout 10

	# Specifies whether remote hosts are allowed to connect to local forwarded ports.
	# The default is no
	GatewayPorts no

	# Indicates that ssh(1) should hash host names and addresses when they are added to ~/.ssh/known_hosts.
	# These hashed names may be used normally by ssh(1) and sshd(8), but they do not visually reveal
	# identifying information if the file's contents are disclosed.
	# The default is no.
	HashKnownHosts no

	# Sets the number of server alive messages (see below) which may be sent without ssh receiving
	# any messages back from the server.
	# The default is 3
	ServerAliveCountMax 3

	# The argument to this keyword must be none (same as the -N option),
	# subsystem (same as the -s option) or default (shell or command execution)
	# TODO: not working
	# SessionType default

	# Directly specify one or more environment variables and their contents to be sent to the server.

	# Keys listed in this file will be refused for host authentication.
	#RevokedHostKeys

	#Specifies a command to execute on the remote machine after successfully connecting to the server.
